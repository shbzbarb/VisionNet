## Overview
The idea behind this project is to use existing open-source resources for image analysis tasks specifically image feature extraction, image classification and image similarity search. The project leverages deep learning models to understand image content and a vector database for efficient retrieval of similar images.

## Core Functionalities

1.  **Image Classification:** Predicts and assigns a descriptive label to an input image using pre-trained models
2.  **Image Feature Extraction:** Converts images into dense numerical vectors. These vectors represent the semantic features of the images, allowing them to be compared
3.  **Image Similarity Search:** Finds images within a collection that are visually similar to a query image. This is achieved by:
    * Extracting the feature vector of the query image
    * Comparing this vector against a database of pre-computed feature vectors (using Milvus Lite)
    * Retrieving the images corresponding to the closest vectors in the feature space

## Technology Stack
The project utilizes the following core libraries and technologies:

* **Deep Learning Framework:**
    * **PyTorch:** Used for building and running the deep learning models
    * **CUDA Support:** Enabled for GPU acceleration
* **Model Hub & Utilities:**
    * **Transformers:** Provides access to state-of-the-art pre-trained models for image classification and feature extraction tasks
* **Vector Database:**
    * **Milvus Lite (`pymilvus`):** An embedded vector database used for efficient storage and fast similarity searching of the extracted image feature vectors
